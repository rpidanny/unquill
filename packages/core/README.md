# Unquill Core - The Heart of Log Parsing

Unquill Core is a critical component of the Unquill project. It provides the core functionality for parsing JSON logs produced by services using the [Quill](https://github.com/rpidanny/quill) logging library. This component serves as the backbone of the Unquill CLI, making JSON logs more human-readable for a better Developer Experience (DX).

## Installation

Install Unquill Core using npm:

```bash
npm i --save @rpidanny/unquill-core
```

## Usage

Unquill Core is primarily designed to be used within the Unquill CLI. For developers interested in extending or customizing log parsing features, refer to the [Unquill CLI](https://github.com/rpidanny/unquill/packages/unquill-cli) component.
